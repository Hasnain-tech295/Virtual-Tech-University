# 🎓 Virtual Tech University — My AI Developer Journey

> *“No degree. No excuses. Just execution.”*

Welcome to the **Virtual Tech University**, a self-directed, 120-day transformation journey where I commit to becoming a world-class AI & Agentic AI Developer — without a traditional college degree.

This repository is my **digital campus**, my notebook, my proof of work, and my public commitment.

---

## 🧭 Vision

To go from zero to an elite AI/Agentic AI engineer — capable of building production-grade intelligent systems, contributing to open-source, and landing opportunities at top companies like **Hugging Face**, **OpenAI**, and beyond.

---

## 📚 Structure

This Virtual University is divided into **Daily Missions**, **Capstone Projects**, and **Internship Applications**.  
It combines theory, real-world projects, API mastery, and deep understanding.

| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 📅 120-Day Timeline  | Daily structured learning & building across AI, Python, LangChain, APIs     |
| 🚀 Capstone Projects | Real-world Agentic AI systems, API apps, vector DB tools                    |
| 🔁 Public Proof      | Regular GitHub pushes, X (Twitter) posts, and open feedback loops           |
| 🧠 Mindset           | Discipline > Motivation. Consistency > Perfection.                          |

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Frameworks

* 🐍 Python (Core language)
* 🧠 LangChain, OpenAI API, Hugging Face
* 📡 FastAPI, Requests, JSON
* 💾 ChromaDB, Pinecone, FAISS (Vector DBs)
* ⚙️ Git, GitHub, VS Code (Workflow)

---

## 🌟 Graduation Goals

By the end of 120 days, I aim to:

* ✅ Build & deploy 3–5 advanced Agentic AI projects
* ✅ Contribute to open-source GenAI libraries
* ✅ Become a **self-certified elite AI engineer**

---

## ❗Rules I Follow

* 📅 Daily push or publish (GitHub/X)
* 💤 No breaks without a valid reason
* 🧪 Projects before perfection — build fast, then refine
* 💬 Document everything (why, how, and what I learned)
* 📈 Growth over comparison — I compete only with yesterday
